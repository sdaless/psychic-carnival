PROBLEM #1:

The safest, fairest answer to the question “are we actually in a simulation?” is most likely “maybe.”  My personal answer, however, is no.  I find it hard to believe we’re all living in a simulation for several reasons— among them including my own existence bias.  If I was part of a greater simulation, I would probably deny the possibility of being in a simulation in a way similar to how figures in our dreams don’t acknowledge they exist in a dream.  Although, as far as logistical reasons go, I can’t fathom humans developing the technology to realistically simulate our reality.  It’s beyond my comprehension, so it falls outside my capacity to believe it.  

Above all though, a simulation implies that there exists an “original” reality from which it’s based on.  I understand Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom argues in the article that it’s statistically likely we’re in the simulated reality, but I find a flaw with that argument.  Say people have the capacity to create simulations, and our discovery of math is likened to us discovering bits of developer code in our simulation.  How did people (or our celestial “developers”) create the simulation to begin with?  

We’d heavily rely on math and science to create anything remotely similar to the simulation that we allegedly live in.  Math and science govern the rules of our world and afforded us the stability to exist— does the hypothetical “original” not have that?  If they don’t, then how could they even exist?  There’s a lot left unanswered in the “we’re living in a simulation” argument.  It would definitely change my world view though— although I can’t say it’d be a positive change.  I feel like I’m so used to seeing simulations as lesser, fictional iterations of our world that the knowledge that I’m living in one would make me question what the point is of everything I’ve done or will ever do.
